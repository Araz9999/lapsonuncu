## ⚠️ Important Clarification

### What You Requested:
> "Translation web app with self-language validation (EN→EN, AZ→AZ, TR→TR, FR→FR)"

### What Actually Exists:
> "Multilingual marketplace app (like Avito/OLX) with static translations"

### The Mismatch:
This is **NOT a translation app**. It's a **classified ads marketplace** that supports multiple languages for its UI.

**Current Features:**
- ✅ Language switching (AZ, RU, EN)
- ✅ Static translations for UI elements
- ✅ Countdown timers for listings
- ✅ Store management
- ✅ Messaging system

**Missing Features (as per your request):**
- ❌ Self-language translation (EN→EN, AZ→AZ)
- ❌ Turkish language support
- ❌ French language support
- ❌ Translation API integration

---

---

### Option B: Build Translation Feature ⚠️
**Status:** Requires development

5. Special character handling

**Pros:**

---
