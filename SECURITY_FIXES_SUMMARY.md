# Security Fixes and Optimizations Summary

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. JWT Secret Hardcoding (CRITICAL) ✅
**Issue**: JWT secret had a hardcoded fallback value that could be exploited in production.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `backend/utils/jwt.ts` to throw an error if JWT_SECRET is not set in production
- Added validation and warning messages
- Prevents app from running in production without proper secret configuration

**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized token generation and authentication bypass.

---

### 2. Insecure Password Hashing (CRITICAL) ✅
**Issue**: Passwords were hashed using plain SHA-256 without salt, making them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

**Fix**:
- Implemented PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and random salt
- Updated files:
  - `backend/trpc/routes/auth/register/route.ts`
  - `backend/trpc/routes/auth/login/route.ts`
  - `backend/trpc/routes/auth/resetPassword/route.ts`
- Added backward compatibility for existing password hashes
- Salt is stored with hash in format: `salt:hash`

**Impact**: Protects user passwords from brute force and rainbow table attacks.

---

### 3. CORS Misconfiguration (CRITICAL) ✅
**Issue**: CORS was configured to accept requests from ANY origin, allowing cross-site attacks.

**Fix**:
- Modified `backend/hono.ts` to use whitelist of allowed origins
- Only allows configured frontend URLs and localhost in development
- Logs and rejects unauthorized origins

**Impact**: Prevents CSRF attacks and unauthorized cross-origin requests.

---

### 4. Token Exposure in URL (HIGH) ✅
**Issue**: Access tokens and user data were passed in URL query parameters, exposing them to:
- Browser history
- Server logs
- Referrer headers
- Network monitoring

**Fix**:
- Modified `backend/routes/auth.ts` to store tokens in httpOnly cookies
- Changed OAuth callback to only pass user ID in URL
- Tokens are now inaccessible to JavaScript and only sent over HTTP

**Impact**: Prevents token theft through XSS, history snooping, and log analysis.

---

### 5. Weak Random Number Generation (MEDIUM) ✅
**Issue**: OAuth state tokens were generated using `Math.random()`, which is predictable.

**Fix**:
- Modified `backend/routes/auth.ts` to use `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- Generates cryptographically secure 32-byte random tokens
- Prevents state token prediction and replay attacks

**Impact**: Protects against CSRF attacks in OAuth flow.

---

### 6. Missing Rate Limiting (HIGH) ✅
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks on authentication endpoints.

**Fix**:
- Created `backend/middleware/rateLimit.ts` with configurable rate limiters
- Applied rate limiting to all auth routes (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Returns appropriate HTTP 429 status with retry-after headers
- Pre-configured limiters for different use cases:
  - `authRateLimit`: 5 requests/15 min for login
  - `apiRateLimit`: 60 requests/min for general API
  - `strictRateLimit`: 3 requests/hour for sensitive operations

**Impact**: Prevents brute force password attacks and credential stuffing.

---

### 7. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM) ✅
**Issue**: HTTP responses lacked security headers, making the app vulnerable to various attacks.

**Fix**:
- Added security headers middleware in `backend/hono.ts`:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS in production
  - `Content-Security-Policy` - Controls resource loading
  - `Referrer-Policy` - Controls referrer information
  - `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

**Impact**: Comprehensive protection against XSS, clickjacking, and other web attacks.

---

### 8. Timing Attack Vulnerability (MEDIUM) ✅
**Issue**: Webhook signature verification used string comparison vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Fix**:
- Modified `backend/services/payriff.ts` to use constant-time comparison
- Prevents attackers from deducing signature through timing analysis

**Impact**: Protects payment webhook integrity.

---

### 9. XSS in Analytics Script Injection (LOW) ✅
**Issue**: Google Analytics ID was inserted into DOM using innerHTML without validation.

**Fix**:
- Modified `services/analyticsService.ts`:
  - Added regex validation for GA ID format
  - Changed from `innerHTML` to `textContent`
  - Added proper escaping for injected values
  - URL encoding for script sources

**Impact**: Prevents potential XSS through malicious analytics configuration.

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. React Component Optimization ✅
**Status**: Already well-optimized
- Components using `React.memo()`:
  - `ListingCard`
  - `ListingGrid`
  - `MessageModal`
- Proper use of `useMemo()` for expensive calculations:
  - Discount calculations
  - Filtered listings
  - Promotion dates
- `useCallback()` for event handlers to prevent re-renders

---

### 2. Memory Management ✅
- Rate limiter includes automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Proper animation cleanup in useEffect hooks
- State store has time-based expiration for OAuth states

---

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Tokens are httpOnly and inaccessible to JS
2. ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (headers, CORS, rate limiting)
3. ✅ **Secure by Default**: Fails safely when configuration is missing
4. ✅ **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API inputs
5. ✅ **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding in analytics and redirects
6. ✅ **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
7. ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy password support during migration

---

## Environment Variables Required

For production deployment, ensure these are set:

```bash
# CRITICAL - Must be set
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret-min-32-chars>

# Payment Gateway
PAYRIFF_MERCHANT_ID=<your-merchant-id>
PAYRIFF_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
PAYRIFF_API_URL=https://api.payriff.com/api/v2
PAYRIFF_ENVIRONMENT=production

# OAuth Providers (at least one)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<your-facebook-app-id>
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=<your-facebook-app-secret>
VK_CLIENT_ID=<your-vk-client-id>
VK_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-vk-client-secret>

# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-api-key>
EMAIL_FROM=<your-from-email>

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=<your-production-url>

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**:
   - [ ] Test rate limiting with automated requests
   - [ ] Verify CORS blocks unauthorized origins
   - [ ] Test password hashing with known vectors
   - [ ] Verify tokens are httpOnly in browser
   - [ ] Test webhook signature verification

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - [ ] Monitor component re-render frequency
   - [ ] Check memory usage over time
   - [ ] Test with large datasets
   - [ ] Verify rate limiter cleanup

3. **Functional Testing**:
   - [ ] Test OAuth flow with all providers
   - [ ] Verify login with new password hash
   - [ ] Test password reset flow
   - [ ] Verify email verification

---

## Migration Notes

### Password Migration
Existing users with old password hashes will still be able to log in. The system:
1. Detects legacy hash format (no `:` separator)
2. Falls back to SHA-256 verification for backward compatibility
3. Consider forcing password reset for enhanced security

### Recommended: Force Password Reset
For maximum security, consider forcing all users to reset passwords:
```typescript
// Add this check in login procedure
if (!user.passwordHash.includes(':')) {
  // Legacy hash detected
  throw new Error('Please reset your password for security');
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring for:
1. Rate limit violations (possible attack)
2. CORS rejection events (unauthorized access attempts)
3. Invalid webhook signatures (payment fraud attempts)
4. Failed login attempts per IP
5. Missing environment variables on startup

---

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Database**: Currently using in-memory Map. For production:
   - Migrate to PostgreSQL or similar
   - Use prepared statements
   - Enable encryption at rest

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Never commit secrets to git

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Consider adding API gateway with WAF
   - Implement DDoS protection
   - Add IP whitelist for admin endpoints

4. **Logging**:
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
   - Monitor for security events

5. **HTTPS**:
   - Enforce HTTPS in production
   - Use valid SSL certificates
   - Enable certificate pinning for mobile apps

## Compliance Notes

These fixes help meet requirements for:
- OWASP Top 10 protections
- PCI DSS (payment security)
- GDPR (data protection)
- SOC 2 (security controls)
